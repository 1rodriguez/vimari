Vimari - Keyboard Shortcuts extension for Safari
================================================

Vimari is a Safari extension that provides keyboard based navigation.  The code is heavily based on 'vimium', a chrome extension that provides much more extensive features.

Vimari attempts to provide a lightweight port of vimium to Safari, taking the best components of vimium and adapting them to Safari.
